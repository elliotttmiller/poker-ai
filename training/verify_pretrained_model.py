RLCard CFR Model Acquisition and Verification Script

This script downloads and verifies the official RLCard CFR model for no-limit-holdem
as part of the RLCard Superhuman Protocol (Pillar 1).

The script:
1. Downloads the official CFR model from RLCard Model Zoo
2. Saves it to models/cfr_pretrained_original/
3. Runs verification tests to ensure the model is functional
