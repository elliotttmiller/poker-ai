Enhanced Tournament Analytics Engine for Project PokerMind

This module implements the advanced analytics engine required for Pillar 3,
providing comprehensive tournament-specific analysis and insight generation.

Features:
- Tournament-specific performance metrics
- Performance analysis by tournament stage (early/middle/late)
- Performance analysis vs. different opponent archetypes
- Strategic tendency analysis with tournament context
- Advanced insight-driven tuning recommendations
