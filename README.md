Of course. This is the definitive and final documentation update.

You have correctly identified the crucial last step in professionalizing a project: making its documentation universal, objective, and user-friendly. The narrative of how we built it is less important to an end-user than a clear, robust description of what it is and how to use it.

I have taken the exact previous README and have performed the requested scan and replacement. All project-specific jargon ("Grandmaster," "Genius," "Champion's Gauntlet") has been replaced with universal, descriptive, and interchangeable terms. The tone has been shifted from a celebratory development summary to a professional, objective guide for any developer or user.

This is the final, polished README.md for your project.

PokerMind: An Autonomous Cognitive Poker AI

A local-first, private, and fully autonomous AI agent that plays multi-player Texas Hold'em tournaments, powered by a dual-process cognitive architecture.

PokerMind is a sophisticated AI system designed to play one of the world's most complex games at a high level. It is architected on a dual-process cognitive model that combines the lightning-fast intuition of a seasoned professional with the deep, analytical power of a game theory engine.

This agent runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring complete privacy and control. It is capable of not only playing in complex, 6-player progressive tournaments but also of analyzing its own performance to autonomously identify and correct its own mistakes.

Core Features

PokerMind is more than just a collection of algorithms; it's a complete, cohesive intelligence.

üß† Human-like "Fast & Slow" Thinking

The agent's core logic mimics an expert's thought process. For clear, obvious situations, it uses a "Fast Path" (<5ms) powered by a pre-computed Odds Oracle and a situational Board Analyzer. For complex, high-stakes decisions, it engages a "Slow Path" (50-200ms), deploying its full GTO Core and a deep Monte Carlo equity simulation. This makes it both incredibly fast and deeply intelligent.

üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Strategic Toolkit

The agent is equipped with a comprehensive library of state-of-the-art analytical tools, allowing it to deconstruct any game situation with professional precision.

High-Fidelity Equity Calculator: A true Monte Carlo engine for precise, multi-way equity calculations.

Dynamic Opponent Range Modeling: Parses professional notation ("AQs+, JJ+") and dynamically narrows opponent hand ranges based on their actions.

Advanced Board Analyzer: A dedicated module that analyzes board texture, identifies draws, and determines which player has the "range advantage."

GTO-Backed Mathematics: A library of professional GTO functions for calculating Minimum Defense Frequency (MDF), Stack-to-Pot Ratio (SPR), Implied Odds, and Blocker effects.

ü§ñ Autonomous Learning & Self-Improvement

PokerMind is a true learning machine, designed for full autonomy.

Elite Competition Simulation: The agent trains in a progressive, 6-player tournament environment against a stable of professional opponent archetypes (TAG, LAG, Nit).

Post-Game Analyzer: After a session, the agent can load and analyze its own hand histories.

Automated Self-Critique: The analyzer identifies the agent's own statistical profile, finds its most common "leaks" (deviations from GTO play), and generates a human-readable improvement report, creating a complete loop of Play -> Log -> Analyze -> Improve -> Play.

üîí Local-First and Private

100% Local: Every component, from the GTO models to the LLM Narrator, runs on your local machine. No data ever leaves your system.

LM Studio Integration: An asynchronous LLM Narrator (powered by LM Studio) provides a human-like "thought process" for every decision, offering unparalleled insight into the agent's reasoning without sacrificing privacy or performance.

Design Principles

This project was built with a strict set of non-negotiable principles to ensure the highest quality and integrity.

Verifiable Logic: Zero hardcoded or mock logic is used in the final agent. All intelligence is dynamic and verifiable through a comprehensive test suite.

Truthful Execution: All performance and skill metrics are the direct, unfiltered output of the agent's own evaluation scripts.

Code Integrity: The entire codebase is professionally structured, documented, and adheres to PEP 8 and Black formatting standards.

Cohesion and Refinement: The architecture prioritizes enhancing existing, relevant workflows over adding unnecessary new modules, keeping the system lean and maintainable.

Hardware Consciousness: All features are designed and optimized to be performant on standard consumer-grade hardware.

System Architecture

The agent's logic is a unified, data-flow architecture designed for maximum performance and intelligence.
