Final Demonstration: The Tournament Mastery Protocol (Champion's Edition)

This script demonstrates the complete implementation of the Tournament Mastery Protocol
as specified in the Final, Unified Master Directive for Prometheus.

It showcases all three pillars:
1. Building and Verifying the Arena
2. The Endurance Gauntlet  
3. The Autonomous Fine-Tuning Loop
